      <h3>Meet Eva (34)</h3>
      <p>
        I have been single for almost 5 years and recently got back
        "in the market". I had no idea how fast things would go when
        joining Winc Planet. It has been a wild ride ever since!

      <h3>Meet John (71)</h3>
      <p>
        I had this strange feeling that a guy my age had nothing
        to look for in this dating jungle of mostly young people.
        Boy was I wrong! Found the love of my within just one week!

      <h3>Meet Susan (23)</h3>
      <p>
        Dating sites are not for me. Or so I thought. But then I
        stumbled upon Winc Planet. It has a wonderful community where I found
        not just the love of my life but also made some very dear friends!
